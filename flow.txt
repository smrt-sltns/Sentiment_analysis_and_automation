task : making email automation available for all the users 
       on sentiment analysis website 

flow: 


** important required steps 
- create abstract user model and add email field null=False, blank=False 
- save a valid access token from account pages to account ads while creating 
  a long lived access token for the account page 


*access token exceptions 
- refresh the page token if the page token is expired

**send a email if the user token is expired 
- take imidiate action on saving new user access token 


# note for 2/8/2023 
- the automation is keeping track on only smart solution 
  but other ad accounts have active campaign (done)

# note for 4/8/2023
- get ids of ad, adset and campaign in myads_utils and save to negative log model
- need to migrate the log models for both negative and positive 
- start populating data in the log models with mail sent status 


# User models and Creds model  
note: creds has onetoone relation with user models 
for now the automation checks for all the users 
later this will be shifted to creds
